# Known Issues & Missing Features

## LLM Integration

| # | Issue | Description |
|---|-------|-------------|
| ~~1~~ | ~~Greeting Not LLM-Generated~~ | ~~Greeting is hardcoded; should be generated by LLM with a dedicated greeting prompt (greetings + suggest random topic + ask first question) that considers target language and CEFR level.~~ ✅ |
| ~~2~~ | ~~Turn Prompts Ignore User Context~~ | ~~`get_response` doesn't incorporate user's target language or CEFR level into the system prompt.~~ ✅ |
| ~~3~~ | ~~Abrupt Session Ending~~ | ~~Stop word triggers immediate end; should use a dedicated ending prompt to have LLM wrap up naturally.~~ ✅ |
| ~~4~~ | ~~LLM Provider Not Configurable~~ | ~~Hardcoded to OpenAI; should support any OpenAI-compatible API with configurable base URL, API key, and model name.~~ ✅ |

## User Settings & Onboarding

| # | Issue | Description |
|---|-------|-------------|
| ~~5~~ | ~~Hardcoded Languages~~ | ~~Primary language, target language, and proficiency level are hardcoded; users should choose these.~~ ✅ |
| ~~6~~ | ~~No Stop Word Configuration~~ | ~~Stop word is hardcoded as "stop session"; PRD requires user-configurable stop word in onboarding.~~ ✅ |
| ~~7~~ | ~~Settings Not Persisted~~ | ~~Settings stored in memory only; lost on server restart. PRD requires settings to persist across sessions.~~ ✅ |

## Frontend UI

| # | Issue | Description |
|---|-------|-------------|
| ~~8~~ | ~~Missing Settings Tab~~ | ~~PRD specifies a Settings Tab for LLM config, languages, and proficiency. No such UI exists.~~ ✅ |
| ~~9~~ | ~~Missing History Tab~~ | ~~PRD specifies a History Tab to list past conversations. No such UI or backend API exists.~~ ✅ |
| 10 | Post-Session Review Missing | Backend returns `SessionAnalysis` (summary + feedback), but frontend has no UI to display it after session ends. (The post-session review show present history in the entire session, and displaying suggestions under the user messages. For better visual comparison, color-code the difference between original_sentence and corrected_sentence) |

## Session Flow

| # | Issue | Description |
|---|-------|-------------|
| ~~11~~ | ~~No TTS for Initial Greeting~~ | ~~Initial greeting is text-only; no audio synthesized via TTS.~~ ✅ |
| ~~12~~ | ~~No Wrap-Up at Max Turns~~ | ~~At 15 turns, session just ends. LLM should generate a natural closing message before ending.~~ ✅ |
| 13 | Missing Topic Selection Flow | PRD specifies: ask for topic → if user provides topic, use it; if user declines, LLM picks random topic. Current greeting just asks generically. |
